	Why choose Tony The Peanut Man?
	<br>
	<br>
	
	Before there was a Tony The Peanut Man, there was Anthony Wright. In 1998 Anthony had a chance encounter with Mr. Marion Hayward 
	who sold peanuts for a living. Mr. Marion Hayward told Anthony, If you can do something for yourself, why not do it, as long as you stand 
	in line you will always be waiting for hand-outs in life. These words struck a cord with Anthony and we have been in business ever since.
	Our products are of the highest quality and can be found in many supermarkets including Piggly Wiggly, BI-LO, and Harris Teeter.
